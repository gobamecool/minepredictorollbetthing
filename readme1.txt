txtRollbet Mines Predictor Extension - Comprehensive Explanation
============================================================

### Overview
The "Rollbet Mines Predictor Extension - Data-Driven & Enhanced" is a sophisticated browser extension crafted to augment the Rollbet Mines gaming experience. This tool leverages advanced prediction algorithms to forecast safe and mine tile locations, utilizing inputs such as client seed, server seed, and nonce. The script features a highly interactive, draggable, and minimizable menu interface, robust data collection capabilities, and flexible import/export options for game data. Developed with a focus on user empowerment and adaptability, it aims to provide a strategic edge while respecting the game's probabilistic nature and maintaining fairness through data-driven insights.

### Development Details
- **Purpose and Goals**: The primary objective is to assist players in making informed decisions by predicting mine placements using a blend of AI-inspired algorithms. It collects historical game data to refine predictions, becoming more effective after accumulating 50+ games, and supports data portability for cross-device use.
- **Technological Stack**: The script is written in pure JavaScript, avoiding external libraries, and harnesses the browser's native `crypto.subtle` API for secure SHA-256 hashing. It employs `MutationObserver` to dynamically respond to page changes, ensuring real-time functionality.
- **Creation Timeline**: Initiated and iteratively improved as of 03:44 PM EDT on Friday, October 03, 2025, with ongoing updates driven by user feedback and adaptations to evolving game interfaces.
- **Inspirational Context**: The development was motivated by the inherent randomness of Mines games and the desire to apply machine learning-inspired techniques (e.g., tree search algorithms) to simulate and predict outcomes effectively.
- **Underlying Assumptions**: The script assumes a consistent game interface with specific CSS class names (e.g., `_3d50fdef`, `_13595ff3`, `_107aa5a2`) and a grid-based layout detectable through DOM manipulation. It also presumes user-provided seed data accuracy for reliable predictions.

### Core Components and Functionality
1. **Data Collection State**:
   - **Variables**: `collectedGames` (array of game records), `pendingPrediction` (current prediction object), `bestAlgorithm` (top-performing algorithm), `rankedAlgorithms` (performance-ranked algorithm list).
   - **Purpose**: Facilitates long-term data storage and analysis, enabling the script to adapt predictions based on historical performance once sufficient data (50+ games) is gathered.

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - `saveData()` / `loadData()`: Handles persistent storage and retrieval of `collectedGames` using `localStorage`, ensuring data retention across sessions.
   - `sha256()`: Implements a cryptographic hash function via the Web Crypto API to process seed data, ensuring deterministic randomization for algorithm inputs.

3. **User Interface**:
   - **Menu Design**: A fixed-position `div` element with a gradient background, positioned at the top-right corner (10px from edges), sized at 270px wide. It includes:
     - Inputs for `clientSeed`, `serverSeed`, `nonce`, `numMines`, and `gridSize` (dropdown with 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8 options).
     - Buttons for `predictBtn`, `toggleBtn`, `importBtn`, and `exportBtn`.
     - Additional controls for `simCount` (simulation iterations) and `algoSelect` (algorithm choice).
   - **Drag Functionality**: Implements drag-and-drop behavior using `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events, tracking `offsetX` and `offsetY` to reposition the menu dynamically.
   - **Minimizable Feature**: A `-` button toggles the menu height between 50px (minimized) and auto (expanded), adjusting `overflow` accordingly.
   - **Selectors Used**:
     - `div._3d50fdef._13595ff3`: Primary selector for game tiles.
     - `div[style*="grid"], div[class*="tile"]`: Secondary selectors for fallback grid detection.
     - `div._107aa5a2`: Targets the fairness tab for seed data extraction.
     - `span`: Parses seed and nonce details within the fairness tab.

4. **Grid Detection Mechanism**:
   - **Function**: `detectGridTiles()`.
   - **Logic**: Initially queries `div._3d50fdef._13595ff3` for tiles. If no matches are found, it attempts `div[style*="grid"], div[class*="tile"]` as a fallback. If still unsuccessful, it resorts to the user-selected `gridSize` from the dropdown, generating a placeholder array (e.g., 7x7 = 49 tiles).
   - **Purpose**: Ensures the script remains functional across different game layouts or updates by providing multiple detection layers.

5. **Prediction Algorithms**:
   - **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**: Executes 1000 simulation iterations, building a tree of possible states, expanding nodes, and backpropagating win rates based on a heuristic (safe tile index divided by total tiles).
   - **Minimax**: Performs 100 shuffles of the tile deck, incrementing safety scores for each safe tile position.
   - **UCT (Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees)**: A MCTS variant with an exploration term to balance exploitation and exploration.
   - **PUCT (Predictor + UCT)**: Enhances UCT with a policy prior (0.4 weight), improving node selection.
   - **Expectimax**: Similar to Minimax but uses expected value scoring over 100 iterations.
   - **Input Processing**: Combines `clientSeed`, `serverSeed`, and `nonce` into a `seedStr` for consistent randomization across algorithms.

6. **Prediction and Toggle Logic**:
   - **Prediction**: The `predictBtn` triggers a computation averaging scores from all algorithms, mapping results to `✅` (safe, >= 0.95), `💣` (mine, <= 0.05), or `❓` (uncertain). Overlays are applied to detected tiles.
   - **Toggle**: The `toggleBtn` switches overlay visibility on/off, reusing the current prediction.
   - **Observer**: A `MutationObserver` on `div._3d50fdef` clears predictions when the game state changes.

7. **Fairness Detection**:
   - Monitors `div._107aa5a2` with a `MutationObserver`, parsing `span` elements for `clientSeed`, `serverSeed`, and `nonce`, and auto-filling input fields.

### Selectors Used in Detail
- **Primary Tile Selector**: `div._3d50fdef._13595ff3` - Assumes this class combination identifies game tiles.
- **Fallback Grid Selectors**: `div[style*="grid"], div[class*="tile"]` - Targets elements with grid styling or tile-related classes.
- **Fairness Tab Selector**: `div._107aa5a2` - Identifies the fairness information panel.
- **Data Extraction Selector**: `span` - Extracts text within the fairness tab to locate seed data.

### What-If Scenarios and Patch Fixes
1. **If Grid Detection Fails Due to Class Changes or Load Delays**:
   - **Scenario**: The game updates its CSS classes (e.g., `_3d50fdef._13595ff3` becomes obsolete) or tiles load asynchronously.
   - **Current Behavior**: Logs a warning and falls back to the dropdown `gridSize`, creating a placeholder array.
   - **Patch Fix**: Implement a retry mechanism with a timeout:
     ```javascript
     function detectGridTiles() {
         let tiles = document.querySelectorAll('div._3d50fdef._13595ff3');
         if (tiles.length === 0) {
             tiles = document.querySelectorAll('div[style*="grid"], div[class*="tile"]');
             if (tiles.length === 0) {
                 console.warn('No tiles detected initially. Retrying...');
                 setTimeout(() => {
                     tiles = document.querySelectorAll('div._3d50fdef._13595ff3') || document.querySelectorAll('div[style*="grid"], div[class*="tile"]');
                     if (tiles.length === 0) {
                         console.warn('Retry failed. Falling back to dropdown grid size.');
                         const gridSize = parseInt(document.getElementById('gridSize').value);
                         return Array.from({ length: gridSize * gridSize });
                     }
                 }, 1000); // Retry after 1 second
             }
         }
         console.log(`Detected ${tiles.length} tiles.`);
         return Array.from(tiles);
     }

Effect: Enhances detection reliability by allowing a second attempt, accommodating delayed page rendering.


If Seed Data is Unavailable or Misparsed:

Scenario: The fairness tab (div._107aa5a2) is hidden, lacks span elements, or contains malformed text.
Current Behavior: Inputs remain empty, halting prediction until manual entry.
Patch Fix: Introduce a manual input prompt as a fallback:
javascriptfunction extractFairnessData() {
    const fairnessTab = document.querySelector('div._107aa5a2');
    if (!fairnessTab || fairnessTab.style.display === 'none') {
        document.getElementById('clientSeed').value = prompt('Enter Client Seed:') || '';
        document.getElementById('serverSeed').value = prompt('Enter Server Seed:') || '';
        document.getElementById('nonce').value = prompt('Enter Nonce:') || '';
        return;
    }
    const spans = fairnessTab.querySelectorAll('span');
    let clientSeed = '', serverSeed = '', nonce = '';
    spans.forEach(span => {
        const text = span.textContent.trim();
        if (text.toLowerCase().includes('client seed')) clientSeed = text.split(':')[1]?.trim() || '';
        if (text.toLowerCase().includes('server seed')) serverSeed = text.split(':')[1]?.trim() || '';
        if (text.toLowerCase().includes('nonce')) nonce = text.split(':')[1]?.trim() || '';
    });
    if (clientSeed) document.getElementById('clientSeed').value = clientSeed;
    if (serverSeed) document.getElementById('serverSeed').value = serverSeed;
    if (nonce) document.getElementById('nonce').value = nonce;
}

Effect: Ensures the script remains operational by allowing user input when automatic detection fails.


If Tile Overlays Are Not Visible Due to CSS Conflicts:

Scenario: Z-index issues, overlapping elements, or style conflicts prevent overlay display.
Current Behavior: Predictions are calculated but not rendered, reducing usability.
Patch Fix: Boost z-index and add diagnostic logging:
javascriptoverlay.style.cssText = `
    position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; 
    display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; 
    font-size: 24px; pointer-events: none; z-index: 10001;
`;
if (!overlay.parentElement) console.error('Overlay failed to attach to tile at index:', index);

Effect: Increases overlay visibility priority and provides error feedback for troubleshooting.


If Algorithm Performance Degrades with New Data:

Scenario: Accumulated collectedGames introduces bias or outdated patterns.
Current Behavior: Predictions may become less accurate without recalibration.
Patch Fix: Add a reset option and algorithm re-ranking:
javascriptconst resetBtn = document.createElement('button');
resetBtn.textContent = 'Reset Data';
resetBtn.style.cssText = `
    width: 100%; padding: 8px; margin-top: 5px; background: #ff6666; border: none; border-radius: 5px; color: #fff; cursor: pointer;
`;
menu.appendChild(resetBtn);
resetBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    collectedGames = [];
    saveData();
    rankedAlgorithms = [];
    bestAlgorithm = null;
    alert('Data and algorithm rankings reset.');
});

Effect: Allows users to clear stale data and restart algorithm optimization.
